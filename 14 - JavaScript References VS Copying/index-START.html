    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', ['test'], 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    //console.log (players);
    

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //const team = players.slice();
    const team = [].concat(players);
    //const team = [...players];
    console.log(team);
    team[2]= 'jared';
    //team[1] = ['hooligan'];
    players[1].push('heya')
    console.log(players);
    console.log(team);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //const per2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 10});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const per2 = [...person];

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
